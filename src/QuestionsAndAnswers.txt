We had a kid in our class who was pure chaos. Came late all the time, forgot stuff, didn't do his homework, disruptive in class... you get the picture. One day he came to school over two hours late and said the bus he was on fell into a sinkhole. Everybody was like "yeah, right", until the news came in that there had indeed been a sinkhole from a tunnel construction and that indeed a bus had slipped into it. We never found out whether our classmate had actually been in it, but he swore he was.

That their homework had been confiscated by Colonel Gadaffi's police. Turns out the kid's father worked for a Libyan bank, and the homework was about aerosols. Kid had gone to visit him during the summer break, and it was taken by the border guards.

What's the lowest test class average that you've experienced? Hello friends, I am barely passing thermo because this past exam had an average of a 36% and he only curved it up to a 58%. What's the worse test average that you've experienced and did they curve?I'm both curious and would enjoy the comfort of shared pain. Thank you.

Class average was a 4%. Professor took away points for every wrong answer, and made the tests as difficult as possible. One question on the last test was, "Name every airplane that I mentioned in class through the semester", this was a manufacturing class lol

I don't really know how the US system really works but 50% are fairly common in Europe. The lowest I've experienced might be a first-year class where the average was below 10% and only a few out of hundreds of people got a passing grade.

In the US, 90-100 is an A, 80-90 is a B, 70-80 is a C, 60-70 is a D, and below is an F. D is usually considered failing.What is the grading scale in Europe?

In Europe the grading varies per country so you can't really compare it to US. But in most countries, more than 55% or 50% is considered passing.

In most of Europe you can very easily get accepted to almost every university you like, even if you didn't get the perfect grades in high school, so universities tend to be a little harder so only the people capable for the job can graduate. For example at my uni, only 44% of people enrolled in the first year get their diploma in the end.

Strangest professor you've ever had?

There was a linear algebra professor at my college that just had many strange quirks. Oftentimes he would be writing on the board then abruptly stop, approach a student, lean in, and just cluck a single “Buh-gawk!” and return to writing as if nothing happened. When asking for proofs, he’d ask for it written in full sentences in Basque. Other times, he’d stop his lesson to complain about how students didn’t know what the word “pedagogy” meant and how that would affect his lesson.

Humans feed, house, and pamper their pets. Dogs realize this and conclude that the humans must be gods, and should be worshiped. Cats realize this and conclude that actually the cats are the gods, and they should be worshiped.
